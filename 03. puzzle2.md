## Puzzle number 1

Every time you refresh the browser one of the requests made by it is a *GET* request to the endpoint */start*.
This wil reset all the puzzles, so if you want to escape by code you will have to do some coding to be able to escape within 2 seconds.
If you use the filter `duo` in the network tab you will see 2 requests every you refresh the room.
1. start, *Request url:* `https://ta-workshop.nl/duo/start`
2. towers, *Request url:* `https://ta-workshop.nl/duo/towers`

First take a look at `start`, which makes sense since we are starting. You can see that both the requests start with `https://ta-workshop.nl/duo`,
so you can use this as a baseUrl. You don't have too, but keeping changing environments in mind,
its alway a good thing to use things like baseUrl variable so in case you need to test against another enviromnent you only have to change one variable.
Second thing which is very important is the **request method**, which in this case is **GET**.  
The last thing you need before you can make your first automated/tool assisted request is the apikey. That key needs to be added to the request headers.

So to create the **request** these are the things to take into account:
1. Use the right **request url** , which is the **baseUrl** followed by **/start**
2. Use the right **request method**, which is **GET**
3. Add the apikey as **request header**

When you are done making your request, its time to handle the response. When you take a look at the response you already got in your HAR file you will see something like:
```json
{  
  "divide": false,  
  "add": true,  
  "multiply": false,  
  "subtract": false,  
  "sum": {  
    "number1": 73,  
    "number2": 395  
  }  
}
``` 
Keep in mind that this assignment is random and changes evertime you make a request to the start url.
So you have to interpret the respons using code. First you have to determine if you have to divide, add, multiply or subtract.
Then you have to extract both numbers from the response, so you can calculate the right answer.
Make sure your code can handle all 4 types of calculations.

Also notice you are only creating the right answer, but you dont actually make the request to use this answer rightaway.
