## Puzzle number 2

To get the assignment for the second puzzle just take a look at the devtools window, or the HAR again and click at **towers** to see what request url, method and headers you need. Also important is to see what response is given in order to solve the second puzzle.

Create the second **request** and take these things into account:
1. Use the right **request url** , which is the **baseUrl** followed by **/towers**
2. Use the right **request method**, which is **GET**
3. Add the apikey as **request header**

When you are done making your request, its time to handle the response. When you take a look at the response you already got in your HAR file you will see something like:
```json
{
  "towers":  {
	"orderType":  "ascending",
	"alphabetic":  false,
	"height":  true,
	"constructionYear":  false
  }
}
``` 
Based on this response you need to compose an answer which will handle all the options. To give away a little secret, the *ordertype* is not random. Its always ascending. The other 3 options are random, which means there are three possible outcomes. You need to order the towers:
1. Alfabetically
2. By height
3. By construction year

Keep in mind you are only creating the right answer, but you dont actually make the request with this answer rightaway.

If you take a look in the HAR file to see what kind of answer is needed for this puzzle you will see something like this json, this is also the answer for case 1, order alfabetically:
```json
{  
  "aKerk": 1,  
  "academieGebouw": 0,  
  "martini": 2,  
  "nieuweKerk": 3,  
  "stJozefKerk": 4  
}
```
The other 2 possibilities are:
By height:
```json
{  
  "aKerk": 3,  
  "academieGebouw": 1,  
  "martini": 4,  
  "nieuweKerk": 0,  
  "stJozefKerk": 2  
}
```
By construction year:
```json
{  
  "aKerk": 1,  
  "academieGebouw": 4,  
  "martini": 0,  
  "nieuweKerk": 2,  
  "stJozefKerk": 3  
}
```
