## Puzzle number 3
The third request is used to answer the first one. You already have coded the answer we need so the first thing to do is figure out which request url and method we need. And take a look if you need extra headers, and how you need te handle the response.

Create the second **request** and take these things into account:
1. Use the right **request url** , which is the **baseUrl** followed by **/combination_lock?solution=143**
2. Use the right **request method**, which is **GET**
3. Add the apikey as **request header**

You probably already noticed that 143 is not always the right solution, so you have to find a way to use the answer you coded when you handled the response from the `/start` request.
When you look at the response you will see that there is nothing to take care of.
``{"response": "Correct, you can go through to the next round"} ``

But when you take a close look at the response headers there is one that needs closer attention.
That is the solution1 header, which contains a number. If you take a look in the HAR at the request headers from the next puzzle you can see that it appears there. You need it in order te solve the next puzzle.
