## Puzzle number 4
This request is used to answer the second one, and get the assignment for the next one. You already have coded the right order of the towers, so all you need to do is use it.  And take a look if you need extra headers, and how you need te handle the response.

Create the second **request** and take these things into account:
1. Use the right **request url** , which is the **baseUrl** followed by **/towers**
2. Use the right **request method**, which is **POST**
3. Add the apikey as **request header**
4. Add the solution1 as **request header**
5. Send the right order in the **request body**

When you fixxed al this you will get a response looking like this:
``{tools:  ["Postman","Playwright","Cypress","Python"]}``

In the response headers you can find a new header called solution2, you will need to add it to your next request, so extract it and store it in a variable

Looking at the poster in de room you will see that there are 5 tools mentioned. So you need to figure which tool is missing, and then store number of the right specialist from the poster in a new variable.
