## Puzzle number 5
This request is used to answer the fourth one, and get the codefor the next one. You already have coded the which number you have to use.  And take a look if you need extra headers, and how you need te handle the response.

Create this **request** and take these things into account:
1. Use the right **request url** , which is the **baseUrl** followed by **/tool_support/call_specialist/00000**
2. Use the right **request method**, which is **GET**
3. Add the apikey as **request header**
4. Add the solution2 as **request header**
5. Send the right number in the **request url**

When you fixxed al this you will get a response looking like this:
```json
{
"response":  "You have called the right specialist. Use the escape code 
             from this response within 25 seconds via the endpoint /remove_lock/{escapecode}",
"escapecode":  644582
}
```
There are no new response headers you need to extract, all you need to do is extract the escapecode and make it
ready to use in the final request. You dont have to worry about the 25 seconds because when you are done you will see how fast the tests will run.
