# Good job escaping the DUO room by *mouse*!

Lets start escaping this room by *code*. First lets go back to the room url, to get the starting state of the room, by refreshing the browser.
Then open devtools, when you ecaped by mouse you have unlocked F12, so hit it and go to the network TAB.

# The challenge
Once you escaped the room using the browser you can see your time at the scoreboard. 
But you will also see that there is one empty column right after your name.
The **Automate in 5 tijd:** column. 
This column will only show a time when you have succesfully escaped from start to finish within 5 seconds.
You wont be able to do that using the browser, so you need automation for this to succeed. 
The api of the room is the way to go. 
You need to figure out which api requests are being done to solve te room.
