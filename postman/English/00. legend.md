# Welcome

We are going to take the following steps to convert our "manual" Postman collection into an "automated" Postman collection. To go through these steps, we assume that you have:

- Manually gone through the duo-escape-room and understand how the different puzzles are connected.

- Recorded a HAR file in Firefox during your escape and analyzed it.

- Imported the HAR file into Postman and removed unnecessary requests from the Postman collection.

On the following pages, you will encounter instruction texts as well as symbols from time to time. These symbols have the following meanings:

### :keyboard: ***Keyboard***

The keyboard symbol represents a step-by-step description. At each step, you will receive instructions on what to do.

### :computer: ***Computer***

When you see the computer symbol, you will have to execute the command entirely on your own. Hopefully, you have gained enough knowledge during the step-by-step instructions to be able to do this.

Enjoy automating. Good luck!!!
